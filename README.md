## Rules:
Game is played on 4x4 board. Start with two "2" tiles, to move them use **arrow keys**. <br />
Combine tiles with the same number in order to get higher valued tile (with the sum of merged tiles). <br />
Every time you move, another tile pops up in a random place (2 or 4 but no larger than what is currently on the board). <br />
If every square on your board is filled with a tile, **you lose** :disappointed: <br />
:trophy:**Objective is to reach 2048 before the board fills up**:trophy:
